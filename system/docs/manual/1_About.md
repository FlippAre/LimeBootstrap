#LimeBootstrap
The LIME-bootstrap is made to make it easier, better and faster working with Actionpads in LIME pro. The framework relies heavily on Knockout.js and Twitter Bootstrap but with custom styling and a simple, yet powerful script called lbs.js. The framework contains several built in functions and third 
party libraries, but is also expandable through custom apps. 


LIME-bootstrap is only meant to be used inside LIME Pro, but for debugging reasons all functionality (except the data connections) should work in any browser. In LIME Pro the supporter browser versions are:

###Versions

*	Internet Explorer 9
*	Internet Explorer 10
*	Internet Explorer 11

Older versions of IE _may_ work, but the ActionPads will surely not look so great.
