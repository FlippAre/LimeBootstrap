#LIME-bootstrap

Welcome to the LIME Pro Actionpad framework called LIME-bootstrap. The LIME-bootstrap is made to make it easier, better and faster working with Actionpads in LIME pto. The framework relies heavily on Twitter bootstrap but with custom styling and a simple, yet powerful script called limejs.js. The framework contains several built in functions and third party libraries, but is also expandable through plugin in custom apps.

##Elements

###The menu

A menu can be created with 

`<ul class="menu">
             <li class="nav-header"> Commands</li>
             <li class="divider"></li>
			 ...
</ul>`

A menu has two properties, Expandable and Hidden. The are added in the `<ul>` class:
`<ul class="menu expandable hidden">`	
	

Expandable: The menu can be collapsed by clicking the heander
Hidden: The menu is collapsed when the actionpad is loaded. Stupid to use without using Expandable...
